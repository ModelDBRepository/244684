<p>The code is in STDP/src<br/>
The main script in STDP/src/main.m<br/>
It has a long header with some info.
</p>
<p>The parameters are gathered in param.m<br/>
The current values correspond to the optimal for P=5 patterns (see Table 1 in the paper)
The simulation takes around 15 min (depending on your system).
</p>
<p>plots.m is launched at the end of main.m to plot the results (similar to Figure 6 in the paper):

<p>perf.m computes some performance indicators
mean_perf.m averages batch results (after running batch.py)
</p>
<p>batch.py is a Python script that launches multiple threads of main.m with different random seeds (see its header for more information)
</p>
<p>The data is read/written in STDP/data/
